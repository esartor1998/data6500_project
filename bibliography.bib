  abstract = {Abstract. The aim of the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) is to serve quality-assessed, georeferenced soil data (point, polygon, and grid) to the international community upon their standardisation and harmonisation. So far, the focus has been on developing procedures for legacy point data with special attention to the selection of soil analytical and physical properties considered in the GlobalSoilMap specifications (e.g. organic carbon, soil pH, soil texture (sand, silt, and clay), coarse fragments (\,{$<$}\,\,2\,mm), cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, bulk density, and water holding capacity). Profile data managed in WoSIS were contributed by a wide range of soil data providers; the data have been described, sampled, and analysed according to methods and standards in use in the originating countries. Hence, special attention was paid to measures for soil data quality and the standardisation of soil property definitions, soil property values, and soil analytical method descriptions. At the time of writing, the full WoSIS database contained some 118\,400 unique shared soil profiles, of which some 96\,000 are georeferenced within defined limits. In total, this corresponds with over 31~million soil records, of which some 20\,\% have so far been quality-assessed and standardised using the sequential procedure discussed in this paper. The number of measured data for each property varies between profiles and with depth, generally depending on the purpose of the initial studies. Overall, the data lineage strongly determined which data could be standardised with acceptable confidence in accord with WoSIS procedures, corresponding to over 4~million records for 94\,441~profiles. The publicly available data \textendash{} WoSIS snapshot of July~2016 \textendash{} are persistently accessible from ISRIC WDC-Soils through doi:10.17027/isric-wdcsoils.20160003.},

Plague epidemics in Europe during the First and Second Pandemics, including the Black Death, are infamous for their widespread mortality and lasting social and economic impact. Yet, Europe still experienced plague outbreaks during the Third Pandemic, which began in China and spread globally at the end of the nineteenth century. The digitization of international records of notifiable diseases, including plague, has enabled us to retrace the introductions of the disease to Europe from the earliest reported cases in 1899, to its disappearance in the 1940s. Using supplemental literature, we summarize the potential sources of plague in Europe and the transmission of the disease, including the role of rats. Finally, we discuss the international efforts aimed at prevention and intervention measures, namely improved hygiene and sanitation, that ultimately led to the disappearance of plague in Europe.},

Despite the historical significance of the disease, the mechanisms underlying the spread of plague in Europe are poorly understood. While it is commonly assumed that rats and their fleas spread plague during the Second Pandemic, there is little historical and archaeological support for such a claim. Here, we show that human ectoparasites, like body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-Industrial Europe. Such an alternative transmission route explains many of the notable epidemiological differences between historical and modern plague epidemics.           ,                             Plague, caused by the bacterium               Yersinia pestis               , can spread through human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14\textendash 19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas (               Pulex irritans               ) or body lice (               Pediculus humanus humanus               ), caused the rapidly spreading epidemics. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346\textendash 1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.},

  abstract = {This database presents work done by Arthur de Graauw to collect, identify and locate ancient harbours and ports. It is based on a study of existing documentation and does not aim to find unknown ports. The result is a list of around 2900 ancient ports based on the writings of 66 ancient authors and a few modern authors, incl. the Barrington Atlas. A harbour is a place where ships can seek shelter. In the concept of "shelter" must be included anchorages, landing places on beaches and ports with structures like, access channels, breakwaters, jetties, landing stages, quays, warehouses for storage of commodities and equipment, shipsheds and slipways for ships. Shelters of interest for this catalogue include all places which may have been used by seafarers sailing over long distances. This means that shelters for e.g. local fishermen who may have landed their boats on the beach in front of their homes, are of lesser interest. Only maritime harbours are listed, but some river ports that could be reached by deep sea ships are also included. EDITOR'S NOTE: Mr. de Graauw is a coastal-civil engineer specializing in ports and maritime infrastructure, and has considerable first-hand knowledge of Mediterranean and other ports and sailing conditions. The written sources in the database have been used in translation, mostly into French, as noted in the author's extensive annotations and commentaries in the complete form of his database and Catalogue. The DARMC Team thinks you will find his work as useful as we do, and therefore are pleased to share it with you on DARMC and in the more complete downloadable spreadsheet version.

The transmissibility of this disease seems to be discontinuous since in some outbreaks few transmissions occur, while in others, the progression of the epidemic is explosive. Modern epidemiological studies explain that transmissibility within populations is heterogenous with relatively few subjects likely to be responsible for most transmissions and that `super spreading events', particularly at the start of an outbreak, can lead to a rapid expansion of cases. These findings concur with outbreaks observed in real-world situations. It is often reported that pneumonic plague is rare and not easily transmitted but this view could lead to unnecessary complacency since future risks such as the spontaneous incidence of anti-microbial strains, climate change leading to a disruption of natural cycles within plague foci and use of plague as a bioweapon cannot be discounted. Carers and first responders are vulnerable, particularly in poorer countries where access to medicines and protection equipment may be limited, outbreaks occur in inaccessible areas or where there is a lack of surveillance due to a paucity of funds.},

However, very little is known of the dynamics of the plague pathogen,               Yersinia pestis               , during the last phase of the Second Plague Pandemic in Europe (18th and 19th century). We present nine ancient               Y. pestis               genomes from the Second Plague Pandemic. CHE1 is the first Second Plague Pandemic genome from the Caucasus region, an area that houses plague wildlife reservoirs to this day, making it a key strain to help elucidate the origin of Medieval and Early Modern plague. Our study documents the importance of a noneurocentric approach to historical plague dynamics and proposes an origin of plague introductions outside of Europe.                        ,                             Plague continued to afflict Europe for more than five centuries after the Black Death. Yet, by the 17th century, the dynamics of plague had changed, leading to its slow decline in Western Europe over the subsequent 200 y, a period for which only one genome was previously available. Using a multidisciplinary approach, combining genomic and historical data, we assembled               Y. pestis               genomes from nine individuals covering four Eurasian sites and placed them into an historical context within the established phylogeny. CHE1 (Chechnya, Russia, 18th century) is now the latest Second Plague Pandemic genome and the first non-European sample in the post-Black Death lineage. Its placement in the phylogeny and our synthesis point toward the existence of an extra-European reservoir feeding plague into Western Europe in multiple waves. By considering socioeconomic, ecological, and climatic factors we highlight the importance of a noneurocentric approach for the discussion on Second Plague Pandemic dynamics in Europe.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a tool for long-term global change studies; it is an update of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) with estimates of some of the underlying demographic driving factors of global change. We estimate total and urban/rural population numbers, densities and fractions (including built-up area) for the Holocene, roughly the period 10 000 BC to AD 2000 with a spatial resolution of 5 min longitude/latitude. With a total global population increase from 2 to 6145 million people over that time span, resulting in a global population density increase of {$<$} 0.1 cap/km               2               to almost 46 cap/km               2               and a urban built-up area evolving from almost zero to 0.5 million km               2               (still only {$<$}0.5\% of the total global land surface, but with a huge impact in terms of demands of food, services, building materials, etc.), it is clear that this must have had, and will continue to have, a profound influence on the Earth's environment and its associated (climate) change. We hope that this data base can contribute to the Earth System Modelers community to gain better insight into long-term global change research.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents an update and extension of HYDE, the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE version 3.2). HYDE is an internally consistent combination of historical population estimates and allocation algorithms with time-dependent weighting maps for land use. Categories include cropland, with new distinctions for irrigated and rain-fed crops (other than rice) and irrigated and rain-fed rice. Grazing lands are also provided, divided into more intensively used pasture and less intensively used rangeland, and further specified with respect to conversion of natural vegetation to facilitate global change modellers. Population is represented by maps of total, urban, rural population, population density and built-up area. The period covered is 10\,000 before Common Era (BCE) to 2015 Common Era (CE). All data can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-25g-gez3.  We estimate that global population increased from 4.4~million people (we also estimate a lower range \,{$<$}\,\,0.01 and an upper range of 8.9 million) in 10\,000\,BCE to 7.257 billion in 2015\,CE, resulting in a global population density increase from 0.03 persons (or capita, in short cap)\,km-2 (range 0\textendash 0.07) to almost 56\,cap\,km-2 respectively. The urban built-up area evolved from almost zero to roughly 58\,Mha in 2015\,CE, still only less than 0.5\,\% of the total land surface of the globe.  Cropland occupied approximately less than 1\,\% of the global land area (13\,037\,Mha, excluding Antarctica) for a long time period until 1\,CE, quite similar to the grazing land area. In the following centuries the share of global cropland slowly grew to 2.2\,\% in 1700\,CE (ca. 293\,Mha, uncertainty range 220\textendash 367\,Mha), 4.4\,\% in 1850\,CE (578\,Mha, range 522\textendash 637\,Mha) and 12.2\,\% in 2015\,CE (ca. 1591\,Mha, range 1572\textendash 1604\,Mha). Cropland can be further divided into rain-fed and irrigated land, and these categories can be further separated into rice and non-rice. Rain-fed croplands were much more common, with 2.2\,\% in 1700\,CE (289\,Mha, range 217\textendash 361\,Mha), 4.2\,\% (549\,Mha, range 496\textendash 606\,Mha) in 1850\,CE and 10.1\,\% (1316\,Mha, range 1298\textendash 1325\,Mha) in 2015\,CE, while irrigated croplands used less than 0.05\,\% (4.3\,Mha, range 3.1\textendash 5.5\,Mha), 0.2\,\% (28\,Mha, range 25\textendash 31\,Mha) and 2.1\,\% (277\,Mha, range 273\textendash 278\,Mha) in 1700, 1850 and 2015\,CE, respectively. We estimate the irrigated rice area (paddy) to be 0.1\,\% (13\,Mha, range 9\textendash 16\,Mha) in 1700\,CE, 0.2\,\% (28\,Mha, range 26\textendash 31\,Mha) in 1850\,CE and 0.9\,\% (118\,Mha, range 117\textendash 120\,Mha) in 2015\,CE.  The estimates for land used for grazing are much more uncertain. We estimate that the share of grazing land grew from 5.1\,\% in 1700\,CE (667\,Mha, range 507\textendash 820\,Mha) to 9.6\,\% in 1850\,CE (1192\,Mha, range 1068\textendash 1304\,Mha) and 24.9\,\% in 2015\,CE (3241\,Mha, range 3211\textendash 3270\,Mha). To aid the modelling community we have divided land used for grazing into more intensively used pasture, less intensively used converted rangeland and less or unmanaged natural unconverted rangeland. Pasture occupied 1.1\,\% in 1700\,CE (145\,Mha, range 79\textendash 175\,Mha), 1.9\,\% in 1850\,CE (253\,Mha, range 218\textendash 287\,Mha) and 6.0\,\% (787\,Mha, range 779\textendash 795\,Mha) in 2015\,CE, while rangelands usually occupied more space due to their occurrence in more arid regions and thus lower yields to sustain livestock. We estimate converted rangeland at 0.6\,\% in 1700\,CE (82\,Mha range 66\textendash 93\,Mha), 1\,\% in 1850\,CE (129\,Mha range 118\textendash 136\,Mha) and 2.4\,\% in 2015\,CE (310\,Mha range 306\textendash 312\,Mha), while the unconverted natural rangelands occupied approximately 3.4\,\% in 1700\,CE (437\,Mha, range 334\textendash 533\,Mha), 6.2\,\% in 1850\,CE (810\,Mha, range 733\textendash 881\,Mha) and 16.5\,\% in 2015\,CE (2145\,Mha, range 2126\textendash 2164\,Mha).},

Starting with the infamous             Black Death             , plague outbreaks are estimated to have killed around 100 million people over multiple centuries, with local mortality rates as high as 60\%. However, detailed pictures of the disease dynamics of these outbreaks centuries ago remain scarce, mainly due to the lack of high-quality historical data in digital form. Here, we present an analysis of the 1630-31 plague outbreak in the city of Venice, using newly collected daily death records. We identify the presence of a two-peak pattern, for which we present two possible explanations based on computational models of disease dynamics. Systematically digitized historical records like the ones presented here promise to enrich our understanding of historical phenomena of enduring importance. This work contributes to the recently renewed interdisciplinary foray into the epidemiological and societal impact of pre-modern epidemics.},

  abstract = {Significance                            The second plague pandemic in medieval Europe started with the Black Death epidemic of 1347\textendash 1353 and killed millions of people over a time span of four centuries. It is commonly thought that after its initial introduction from Asia, the disease persisted in Europe in rodent reservoirs until it eventually disappeared. Here, we show that climate-driven outbreaks of               Yersinia pestis               in Asian rodent plague reservoirs are significantly associated with new waves of plague arriving into Europe through its maritime trade network with Asia. This association strongly suggests that the bacterium was continuously reimported into Europe during the second plague pandemic, and offers an alternative explanation to putative European rodent reservoirs for how the disease could have persisted in Europe for so long.                        ,                             The Black Death, originating in Asia, arrived in the Mediterranean harbors of Europe in 1347 CE, via the land and sea trade routes of the ancient Silk Road system. This epidemic marked the start of the second plague pandemic, which lasted in Europe until the early 19th century. This pandemic is generally understood as the consequence of a singular introduction of               Yersinia pestis               , after which the disease established itself in European rodents over four centuries. To locate these putative plague reservoirs, we studied the climate fluctuations that preceded regional plague epidemics, based on a dataset of 7,711 georeferenced historical plague outbreaks and 15 annually resolved tree-ring records from Europe and Asia. We provide evidence for repeated climate-driven reintroductions of the bacterium into European harbors from reservoirs in Asia, with a delay of 15 {$\pm$} 1 y. Our analysis finds no support for the existence of permanent plague reservoirs in medieval Europe.},

  abstract = {Background                                Plague is a re-emerging flea-borne infectious disease of global importance and in recent years, Zambia has periodically experienced increased incidence of outbreaks of this disease. However, there are currently no studies in the country that provide a quantitative assessment of the ability of the disease to spread during these outbreaks. This limits our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease especially for planning and implementing quantifiable and cost-effective control measures. To fill this gap, the basic reproduction number, R                 0                 , for bubonic plague was estimated in this study, using data from the 2015 Nyimba district outbreak, in the Eastern province of Zambia. R                 0                 is the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infectious individual during their infectious period in an entirely susceptible population.                                                        Methodology/Principal findings                                Secondary epidemic data for the most recent 2015 Nyimba district bubonic plague outbreak in Zambia was analyzed. R                 0                 was estimated as a function of the average epidemic doubling time based on the initial exponential growth rate of the outbreak and the average infectious period for bubonic plague. R                 0                 was estimated to range between 1.5599 [95\% CI: 1.382\textendash 1.7378] and 1.9332 [95\% CI: 1.6366\textendash 2.2297], with average of 1.7465 [95\% CI: 1.5093\textendash 1.9838]. Further, an SIR deterministic mathematical model was derived for this infection and this estimated R                 0                 to be between 1.4 to 1.5, which was within the range estimated above.                                                        Conclusions/Significance                                This estimated R                 0                 for bubonic plague is an indication that each bubonic plague case can typically give rise to almost two new cases during these outbreaks. This R                 0                 estimate can now be used to quantitatively analyze and plan measurable interventions against future plague outbreaks in Zambia.},

The empirical analysis uses disaggregate data from Germany and exploits geographic variation in the exposure to medieval plague shocks. The findings document that areas with greater exposure to plague outbreaks exhibited an earlier onset of the demographic transition. The results are consistent with the predictions of the unified growth literature and provide novel insights into the largely unexplored empirical determinants of the timing of the transition from stagnation to growth.},

In Central Asia, where human plague is still reported regularly, the bacterium is common in natural populations of great gerbils. By using field data from 1949\textendash 1995 and previously undescribed statistical techniques, we show that               Y. pestis               prevalence in gerbils increases with warmer springs and wetter summers: A 1\textdegree C increase in spring is predicted to lead to a {$>$}50\% increase in prevalence. Climatic conditions favoring plague apparently existed in this region at the onset of the Black Death as well as when the most recent plague pandemic arose in the same region, and they are expected to continue or become more favorable as a result of climate change. Threats of outbreaks may thus be increasing where humans live in close contact with rodents and fleas (or other wildlife) harboring endemic plague.},

The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports, but later this conclusion became controversial. We show here that the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2\textendash susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and that within the market, SARS-CoV-2\textendash positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. Although there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred through the live wildlife trade in China and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.           ,              Pandemic epicenter                            As 2019 turned into 2020, a coronavirus spilled over from wild animals into people, sparking what has become one of the best documented pandemics to afflict humans. However, the origins of the pandemic in December 2019 are controversial. Worobey               et al               . amassed the variety of evidence from the City of Wuhan, China, where the first human infections were reported. These reports confirm that most of the earliest human cases centered around the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Within the market, the data statistically located the earliest human cases to one section where vendors of live wild animals congregated and where virus-positive environmental samples concentrated. In a related report, Pekar               et al               . found that genomic diversity before February 2020 comprised two distinct viral lineages, A and B, which were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans (see the Perspective by Jiang and Wang). The precise events surrounding virus spillover will always be clouded, but all of the circumstantial evidence so far points to more than one zoonotic event occurring in Huanan market in Wuhan, China, likely during November\textendash December 2019. \textemdash CA                        ,              Spatial distributions of early cases and environmental samples show that SARS-CoV-2 emergence was associated with the wildlife trade.},
